/******************************************************************************  
 * @file       main.c
 * @brief      Main source file for the setup and implementation of AD594x apps.
 * 
 * @author     Andr√©s Alberto Andreo Acosta
 * @version    V1.0.0
 * @date       October 2024
 * 
 * @par        Revision History:
 *              * Added support for other ESP32 boards.
 *              * Checked for redundant includes.
 * 
 * @todo       * Implement Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and MQTT functionality.
 *             * Re-implement SPI transactions to use tx and rx data instead of buffers.
 *             * Analyse the need for SPI lazy init.
 *             * Implement UART-INTR functionality if needed.
 * 
 * 
 * It is intended to include all the calls to initialise and configure the
 * AD594x, along with the implementation of the application code of choice 
 * to be run on the MCU. Thus, it uses the port file of the ESP32 board family 
 * as suggested by Analog Devices, Inc. in the AD594x porting guide.
