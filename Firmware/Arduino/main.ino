 * @brief      Main source file for the setup and implementation of AD594x apps.
 * 
 * @author     Andr√©s Alberto Andreo Acosta
 * @version    V1.0.0
 * @date       February 2025
 * 
 * @par        Revision History:
 * 
 * @todo       * Implement Wi-Fi, MQTT, BLE and NFC connectivity protocols.
 * 
 * 
 * It is intended to include all the calls to initialise and configure the
 * AD594x, along with the implementation of the application code of choice 
 * to be run on the MCU. Thus, it uses the port file of the ARDUINO board family 
 * as suggested by Analog Devices, Inc. in the AD594x porting guide.
 * 
 * ****************************************************************************
 * This software is built in collaboration with JLM Innovation GmbH.
 * 
 * It is intended for use in conjunction of ARDUINO IDE.
