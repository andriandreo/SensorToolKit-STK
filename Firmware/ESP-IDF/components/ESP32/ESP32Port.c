 * @brief      (Generic) ESP32 board port file.
 * 
 * @author     Andr√©s Alberto Andreo Acosta
 * @version    V2.0.0
 * @date       January 2025
 * 
 * @par        Revision History:
 *              * Added support for other ESP32 boards.
 *              * Implemented Wi-Fi and MQTT functionality.
 *              * Checked for redundant includes.
 * 
 * @todo       * Implement Bluetooth functionality.
 *             * Re-implement SPI transactions to use tx/rx data instead of buffers.
 *             * Analyse the need for SPI lazy init.
 *             * Implement UART-INTR functionality if needed.
 * 
 * 
 * This software is a port of the AD5940 driver for the ESP32 board
 * built from the software provided by Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI).
